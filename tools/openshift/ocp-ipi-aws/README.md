# OCP-IPI tool

This set of scripts is designed to update openshift-installer provisioned AWS infrastructure
to host submariner properly. Submariner needs at least one worker node with an external IP
address, and marked with the submariner.io/gateway=true label.

You can use the prep_for_subm.sh script on your openshift install directory with your AWS
credentials correctly sourced.

```bash
cd my-cluster-openshift-install-dir
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/submariner-io/submariner/master/tools/openshift/ocp-ipi-aws/prep_for_subm.sh -L -O
chmod a+x ./prep_for_subm.sh
./prep_for_subm.sh
```

You can override some of the defaults by using environment variables, like:

```bash
export IPSEC_NATT_PORT=4501
export IPSEC_IKE_PORT=501
export GW_INSTANCE_TYPE=m4.xlarge
./prep_for_subm.sh
```
